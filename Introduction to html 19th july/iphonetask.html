<h1>Nothing Phone 1 Design</h1>
<p>Nothing founder Carl Pei had promised that its first smartphone will stand apart from its competitors, and it is safe to say they have succeeded. The Nothing Phone (1) comes with a bezel-less display, giving it a uniform width across the screen. The frame is made from completely recycled aluminium.

<p>However, the most striking and talked about aspect of the device is the back, which features a transparent design. The phone “shows off” its internals, something that no other manufacturer has done with their products yet. The back of the Nothing Phone (1) also features a number of LED lights, dubbed the Glyph Interface. The LEDs have unique light patterns depending upon the scenario, for example, the LED lights on the bottom of the phone acts as a charging indicator. There are also preset ringtones that uses the Glyph Interface which lights up the LEDs in a set pattern in sync with the ringtone. Furthermore, users can add their own sounds, which the LEDs automatically sync to.</p>
